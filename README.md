# Cloud Project
## Project for cloud exam

##  Tasks
Identifying, deploying and implementing a cloud-based file storage system. The system should allow users to upload, download and delete files. Each user should have a private storage space. The system should be scalable, secure, and cost-efficient.

## Choice of the solution

Regarding project tasks, the first choice fell on Nextcloud. The reasons are:

- file sharing and collaboration with user-friendly interface, including non-technical users;
- strong privacy controls and open-source software;
- small to medium-sized stogare needs and an easy-to-deploy solution.

In contrast, in real world use with big data projects, where primary requirements is high-performance, scalable object storage, MinIO might be the more suitable choice. 

Obviously, the decision depends on specific requirements, the scale of deployments and the features most important regards different kinds of projects/works.

## Documentation, Code and Presentation

In this repository, will be available: 

- Documentation where is explained and described the platform's architecture, including components, databases and their interactions, with a section on the security measures taken.
- Docker files and any code developed/modified for the cloud-based file storage system, with a README file with instructions on how to deploy and use the system developed.
- A short presentation summarizing the design and implementation.
